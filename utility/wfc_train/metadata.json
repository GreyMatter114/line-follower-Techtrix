The images are in a 45x45 pixel grid format where each pixel represents an element of the maze in greyscale: walls and paths. This comprehensive dataset is designed for use in a variety of applications including, but not limited to, algorithm development, machine learning, and educational purposes related to computational problem-solving and image analysis.\n\n**Objective:**\nTo provide a rich dataset for the development, training, and benchmarking of algorithms in the fields of pathfinding, image recognition, and machine learning.\n\n**Size:**\nNumber of Images: 5,000,000\nDimensions of Each Image: 45x45 pixels\nImage Format: PNG (Portable Network Graphics), lossless compression\n\n**Pixel Values:**\n1. Wall pixels: Value (0) (Black)\n2. Path pixels: Value (255) (White)\n\n**Pixel Value (0-255):**\n The grayscale value indicating the type of maze element.\n\n**Data Quality:**\nThe dataset has been generated and curated to ensure high fidelity and uniformity across all images. The greyscale format and the PNG image type ensure that the quality of the image data is preserved without loss.\n\n**Use Cases:**\nCreation of educational tools for demonstrating computational thinking and problem-solving.\nResearch in AI for recognizing and interpreting complex patterns and structures in images.\nBenchmarking of pathfinding algorithms in simple to complex maze structures."}
